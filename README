NAME
    Kite - collection of modules useful in Kite design and construction.

SYNOPSIS
        use Kite;

        my $profile = Kite->profile(...)
            || die $Kite::ERROR;

        my $xml2ps = Kite->xml2ps(...)
            || die $Kite::ERROR;

        my $xml_parser = Kite->xml_parser(...)
            || die $Kite::ERROR;

DESCRIPTION
    The Kite::* modules are a collection of Perl modules and scripts written
    to help with various tasks in the design and construction of traction
    kites.

    The Kite module acts as a general interface to the other modules in the
    collection, providing factory methods for loading and instantiating
    them.

METHODS
  profile()

    Loads the Kite::Profile module and calls the new() constructor. All
    parameters are forwarded to the constructor.

    This example:

        use Kite;
    
        my $profile = Kite->profile( name => 'My Profile', ... )
            || die $Kite::ERROR, "\n";

    is equivalent to:

        use Kite::Profile;

        my $profile = Kite::Profile->new( name => 'My Profile', ... )
            || die $Kite::Profile::ERROR, "\n";

  xml2ps()

    Loads the Kite::XML2PS module and calls the new() constructor. All
    parameters are forwarded to the constructor as per the previous example.

  xml_parser()

    Loads the Kite::XML::Parser module and calls the new() constructor. All
    parameters are forwarded to the constructor as per the previous
    examples.

MODULES
    The following modules are distributed with the Kite bundle.

  Kite

    Front-end for the Kite::* modules. Contains factory methods for loading
    modules and instantiating objects of other Kite::* classes.

  Kite::Base

    Base class implementing common functionality such as error reporting.

  Kite::Profile

    Module defining an object class used to represent and manipulate 2D
    profiles.

  Kite::XML2PS

    Module to convert a curve definition from OpenKite XML format to
    PostScript. Provides automatic page tiling, path following text,
    registration marks, etc.

  Kite::XML::Parser

    Module for parsing an XML file and generating a representative tree of
    node (element) objects.

  Kite::XML::Node

    Base class for XML element nodes created by Kite::XML::Parser.

  Kite::XML::Node::Kite

    Derived node elements specific to Kite markup (e.g. Kite, Part, Outline,
    Curve, Point, etc.)

  Kite::PScript::Defs

    Module defining a number of PostScript definitions useful for generating
    PostScript documents for kite part layout, etc.

SCRIPTS
    The following scripts are distributed with the Kite bundle.

  okprof

    Utility script providing a user interface to the Kite::Profile module.
    Allows 2D profiles to be loaded and manipulated via simple commands. See
    'perldoc okprof' or 'okprof -h'.

  okxml2ps

    Utility script for converting XML kite part definition and layout markup
    to PostScript. Uses the Kite::XML2PS module.
